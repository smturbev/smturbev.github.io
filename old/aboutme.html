										<h2>Current Position</h2>
										<p>University of Washington Research Assistant</p>
									</header>
									<p>I am a third year graduate student in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington
										working with Tom Ackerman, Chris Bretherton, Peter Blossey and Jacqueline Nugent. Under the
										NSF PIRE grant, my work is closely tied to others working in the field of TTL cirrus. We have
										weekly reading group and/or presentations about related work (For more info contact me).
									</p>
									<p>I am also involved in the python club in atmos at UW. For tutorials and resources check out
										<a href="python.html">this page</a>. We cover topics such as conda and virtual environments,
										personal webpages creation, jupyterlab and notebook, and more. This is an on-going effort
										with Aeodhan Sweeney, Claire Zarakas, and Jacqueline Nugent with help from everyone in the
										atmos-python club.

										<h2>Academic Tree</h2>

									<p>It is always important to remember who helped you get here. This is my academic tree going back to Poisson, Hertz, and Poincare.
										Yet, there are no women in that tree until my generation. So I figure I should list my female role models even if they aren't in my "lineage."
									</p>
									<header class="style2">
										<!-- <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
									</header>
									<p><li><strong>Sylvia Earle:</strong> she came to Colby College and gave a talk about her work. It was so inspiring that I researched similar fields such
										as atmospheric and oceanic sciences that ultimately led to my attendence to the UW Atmospheric Sciences Program.</li>
										<li><strong>Jan Holly:</strong> one of my favorite professors, I took ordinary differential equations, partial differential
											equations, and the mathematics of sports from her at Colby College. I love her enthusiasm towards mathematics, friendliness towards her students,
											and amazing research quality. Along those lines <strong>Stephanie Taylor</strong> always encouraged me in
											computer science which gave me a real head start
											in coding in grad school.</li>
										<li><strong>Susan Soloman</strong> & <strong>Joanne Simpson</strong></li>
										<li>Shuyi Chen</li> -->
									<!-- </p>
									<p>Still not included on that list or in the tree are people of color. This deeply saddens me but folks such as <strong>Raychelle Burks</strong>,
										<strong>Neil DeGrass Tyson</strong>, and <strong>Mae Jemison</strong> (and all astronauts, really)
										as well as the folks above and my peers inspire me today
										to continue on this path towards my PhD even when I've discovered the one millionth problem with the model output or
										spent 3 hours debugging my code. </p> -->

										<h2>My Background</h2>
									</header>
									<header class="style2">
										<h3>Colby College</h3>
									</header>
									<p> My undergraduate degree is in Mathematical Sciences from Colby College in Maine. There, my scientific
										inquiry began. I worked with Scott Taylor in the Math department studying knot theory which turned into
										research on Dehn Twists. While I didn't produce any impact in the field, it sparked my
										interest in research sciences. I turned away from theoretical mathematics and toward a more applied science
										that spoke to my roots and appreciation for nature. Thus, I applied for graduate school in Atmospheric Sciences.
									</p>
									<header class="style2">
										<h3>My roots</h3>
									</header>
									<p> Growing up in Pukalani, Hawaii, my love and respect for the environment and science began.
										<i>Malama na 'aina.</i> It is our <i>kuleana</i> to do so.
									</p>
									<p>	I am interested in both the radiation of the atmosphere
										(specifically dealing with tropical clouds) and the radiation of baking (with my sourdough
										starter named DoughVID19). My research focuses on the radiative properties of TTL cirrus and
										the lifecycle of tropical systems in high resolution models. To stay sane during lockdown,
										I baked lots and lots of sourdough bread from rosemary crackers to naturally leavened
										boules which I have continued as things open up again.</p>

										<h3>Hobbies</h3>

									<p>
										<li>Sourdough Bread Baking (Community Loaves Project)</li>
										<li>Biking around Seattle</li>
